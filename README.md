This tool enable anyone to visualize any option's implied volatility surface through a Dash app. 
Please save this file and go to your anaconda prompt and type "python thefilename", it should return a html link.

This highlight the vol smile and term structure. The surface is smoothed thanks to a spline interpolator.
An hyperplane is set to help visualize the level of vol.

The tool uses yahoo_fin library to get option chain data.

NOTES : the spline is rudimentary hence some surface can be sketchy, this is part of future work.
